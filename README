What?
Coding Dojo played during Jan 27th

Where? 
Trevisan Tecnologia (http://www.trevisantecnologia.com.br)

Why?
Team is looking for asynchronous technologies, so this time we played 
refactoring a hornetq sample from the install.

More? 
Stay tuned for more samples being created around this Org [TrevisanTecnologia].

How to run this code? 
In this case, code must be placed inside the examples/jms directory from 
hornetq install. If you want some other directory, just update your 
build.sh/build.bat and build.xml to the right path.
